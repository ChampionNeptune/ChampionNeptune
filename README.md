# Rust Kit Builder Tool

The Rust Kit Builder Tool is a web-based application designed to help Rust server admins easily create and customize in-game kits. The tool allows users to select items, specify quantities, conditions, and inventory locations, and generates commands that can be copied directly into the Rust server console. The tool also includes features to modify or remove individual kit items before finalizing the commands.

## Features

- **Autocomplete for Items**: Type in an item name, and the tool will suggest matching items from the Rust game.
- **Item Details**: Specify the quantity, condition, and container (Main, Belt, Wear) for each item.
- **Dynamic Command List**: View all items added to the kit in a dynamic list that updates as you add or remove items.
- **Minus Condition Feature**: Remove the condition requirement from items that don't need it with a simple click.
- **Delete Command Feature**: Easily remove any item from the kit before finalizing.
- **Copy Kit Commands**: Copy all commands to the clipboard with a single button click for easy pasting into the Rust server console.
